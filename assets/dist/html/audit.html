                <h1>CUSTOMIZED AUDIT</h1>
                <p>Managing risk today means putting in place effective controls along the value chain. Customers today hold companies responsible for social and environmental performance throughout their supply chains, making supplier risk assessment a priority. But companies also need to ensure their own manufacturing sites, retail outlets and distribution networks are up to scratch. The aim: to maintain high standards from production to point of sale, and in doing so, protect reputation.</p>
